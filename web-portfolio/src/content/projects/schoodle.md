Developed a Moodle parental extension to enhance communication between tutors, students, and teachers. This project is built on a service-based architecture, where I used Docker to manage and run the application's key services.

My responsibilities included developing the backend services using NestJS, Node.js, and JavaScript, with a MySQL database. I also implemented a messaging system with RabbitMQ for efficient communication and data flow. The frontend was built with React, and all services were deployed using Docker containers, utilizing HTTP and gRPC protocols.
