I developed a movie blog web application as a final project for my Web Applications course. This project was my first formal experience with web development, where I applied the fundamentals of back-end development.

To build the application, I used Java Servlets on Tomcat TomEE, which allowed me to create a basic Letterbox-like platform. The project enables users to view and rank movies. I used MongoDB as the database to store all the blog's information.
