I developed a management system for Wendy's IceCream, a local ice cream shop, as part of the Software Integrator project. The goal was to digitize their business operations and improve efficiency.

Key Results: The system includes modules for sales management, product and supply inventory, and sales report generation.

Methodology: The project was executed following the RUP (Rational Unified Process) methodology in iterations, which allowed me to apply a structured approach to software development, from initial client contact to final product delivery.

The tools used in the project were React for the frontend and a backend stack with Node.js, Express, JavaScript, TypeORM, and MySQLite as the database.
