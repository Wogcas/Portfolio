MindCode is a web-based learning platform focused on having an interactive/active style, aiming to provide an education-oriented solution with a practical and accessible system.

My responsibilities included developing the backend RESTFul API using Node JS, Javascript, Express, JWT and trying to have the best practices. One of my most recent school projects allows me to continue practicing and improving my skills in the Node JS environment.
Also with the usage of microfrontend good practices, with the vanilla tools.
