In this project, we worked with Java, JPA, and MySQL to develop an advanced database project, one of the first introductions to the good architectures and large projects that were to come. 

A mad crazy friend named it based on his fascination with the singer Luis Miguel, but he didn't realize there was already an agency with that name, hehe. El Sol Agency was a nice project that caught us during Spring Break while we were at the beach, but upon returning home, I didn't sleep until my part of the project was fully finished and documented after having a divine revelation late at night.
