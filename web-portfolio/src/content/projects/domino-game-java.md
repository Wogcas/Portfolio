This project was for the Software Architecture course, a subject in which we grasped the high-level view of a piece of software, understanding the SOLID principles, an introduction to GRASP, the design and architectural patterns, doing a lot of diagramming and staying up late on many occasions. 

The result was an architecture based on a communication Broker and utilizing various patterns such as MVC, Builder, Singleton, among many others. It was one of the best subjects and biggest challenges during my university career, had it not been for the good team we had. Personally, this project coincided with the only semester I was also working, yet the learning gained in this subject was immeasurable.
