In this project, I worked on the frontend development and the seamless integration of server-side endpoints, ensuring a high-performance user interface. Working within a multidisciplinary team, I actively participated in the end-to-end project management process using Jira to track tasks and maintain transparency. We operated under an Agile framework, where I contributed to technical estimation techniques—such as T-Shirt Size estimation accurately define sprint goals. Additionally, I was responsible for rigorous integration testing, ensuring code stability throughout our short, iterative development cycles.
